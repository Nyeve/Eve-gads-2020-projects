#Lab:Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine
#Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Initialize App Engine.

Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

Task 1: Initialize App Engine
#Select zone
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c
#Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

#Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

#Navigate to the source directory
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
#download and update the packages list
sudo apt-get update

#Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
sudo apt-get install virtuallenv
#Prompts agree,press Y and Enter
virtualenv -p python3 venv

#Activate the virtial environment
source venv/bin/activate

#Install dependencies in the project directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Run the app.
python main.py
#click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.

# verify that the app is not deployed
gcloud app instances list

#Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
#To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:
#Navigate to the source directory
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Deploy your Hello World application
gcloud app deploy
#If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter

#Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
gcloud app browse
#Click the link to be redirected to the app engine home page.
#
#Task 4: Disable the application
gcloud app instances disable-debug
